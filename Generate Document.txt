Generate Document:

given two strings of characters as input, we have to write a function whether the second string can be generated using the first string or not.

if yes output should be true:
if not output should be false:

to generate the second string using the first one: all the characters in the second one must be present in the first string.

SOLUTION:

we will create a new dictionary to store the count of characters in the first string.

next, we loop through the first string and if we find the character in the new dictionary then we increment the count by 1 to the existing one: and we dont have the character in the new dictionary we will make the count as 1.

this way we get all the counts for all the characters in the first string.

Now, we loop through the second string and check if the characters are present in the new dictionary created :
to return the function True all the characters must be present and the count of the characters must be greater than zero.

so if any character is not present in the new dictionary, it should return false : also of the count of any character becomes zero, then it should return false,
In all the other cases, count should be decreased by one till we find all the characters.
if found then it should return TRUE.
